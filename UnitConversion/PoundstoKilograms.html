        <p>1kg / 2.2046lb</p>
        <p>The pound was a unit of account in Anglo-Saxon England, equal to 240 silver pennies and equivalent to one pound weight of silver. It evolved into the modern British currency, the pound sterling. ... 
            The origins of sterling lie in the reign of King Offa of Mercia (757–796), who introduced the silver penny.</p>
            <p>The pound or pound-mass is a unit of mass used in the imperial, United States customary and other systems of measurement. 
                Various definitions have been used; the most common today is the international avoirdupois pound, which is legally defined as exactly 0.45359237 kilograms, and which is divided into 16 avoirdupois ounces.[1]
            </p>
            <p>The kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one litre of water. ... 
                In 1889, a cylinder of platinum-iridium, the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK) became the standard of the unit of mass for the metric system, and remained so until 2019.</p>
                <p>It was supposed to be the measurement system for all people, in all places, for all time—one which used the natural world as its basis. 
                    But in the centuries since king Louis XVI of France first tasked a group of scientists to help him develop a new system of measurement, many of the foundations of the metric system have been shown to be fundamentally unsound. 
                    Few features of the system have been more troublesome than the measurement standard for the kilogram, which may change for good after a vote coming up this week at the annual General Conference on Weights and Measures.</p>
